# Typescript Template
<h4 align="justify">
This is my default template for typescripts projets, it features ESLint, Jest and Babel. Those dependencies help me with automatic fixes, tests and code build. Other than that I use Visual Studio Code and, a Windows machine for general work and a Ubuntu Server for running my personal applications.
